My solution to all projects of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The course consists of the three main ML topics, plus model evaluation and validation

**Model Evaluation and Validation**

 *Model evaluation*
 
 Confusion matrix, scoring: precision, recall, fbeta, ROC, R2 (coefficient of variation)
 
 *Model Validation*
 
 High variance and bias problems, cross validation , learning curves, grid search, randomized search
 
**Supervised Learning**

topics covered in this section:
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines

**Neural Networks**


**Unsupervised Learning**
