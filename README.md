My solution to all projects of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The course consists of the three main ML topics, plus model evaluation and validation.

**Model Evaluation and Validation**

 *Model evaluation:*
 
 Confusion matrix, scoring: precision, recall, fbeta, ROC, R2.
 
 *Model Validation:*
 
 High variance and bias problems, cross validation , learning curves, grid search, randomized search.
 
**Supervised Learning**

Topics covered in this section:
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines

**Neural Networks**

Topics covered in this section:
 * general concepts of NNs
Perceptron trick, perceptron algorithm, sigmoid activation, maximum likelihood, cross entropy, logistic regression, perceptron and gradient descent.
 * Deep neural networks.
Regularization, dropout, vanishing gradients and activation function, momentum, keras optimisers.
* Convolutional neural networks
Model validation, image augmentation using TensorFlow.

**Unsupervised Learning**

Topics covered in this section:

 * Clustring
K-means clustering.
Hierarchical and density-based clustering.
Hierarchical clustering, single-link clustering, complete-link clustering, average-link clustering, ward's method, DB scan.
 * Gaussian mixture model and cluster validation.
EM algorithm, cluster validation, external indices, internal indices, adjusted rand indices, silhouette coefficient.
