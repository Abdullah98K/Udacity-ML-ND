My solution to all projects of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree.

The course consists of the three main ML topics, plus model evaluation and validation.

**Model Evaluation and Validation**

 *Model evaluation:*
 
 Confusion matrix, scoring: precision, recall, fbeta, ROC, R2.
 
 *Model Validation:*
 
 High variance and bias problems, cross validation , learning curves, grid search, randomized search.
 
**Supervised Learning**

Topics covered in this section:
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Trees
  * Support Vector Machines

**Neural Networks**

Topics covered in this section:

Perceptron trick, perceptron algorithm, sigmoid activation, maximum likelihood, cross entropy, logistic regression, perceptron and gradient descent
Deep neural networks.
Regularization, dropout, vanishing gradients and activation function, momentum, keras optimisers.
Model validation, image augmentation using TensorFlow.

**Unsupervised Learning**

Topics covered in this section:

K-means clustering.
